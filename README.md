# Coding-Convergence

Coding Convergence is a creative coding project that sort to create a trap remix of the indie/pop song 'Eat Your Young' by Hozier. The project consists of an introduction, a first and second verse, a bridge/interlude and two choruses and a short outro of 10 beats.

## General Information

Coding Convergence aims to marry (converge) the coding languages of python and musical notation to create a cohesive piece of music solely through code. The purpose of this project is to recreate muscial complexity and depth through code and to test my own ability as a first-time coder and out-of-practice musician. I undertook this challenge as music is a passion I have negelcted for a number of years and I hoped to rebuild some of the skill I had lost and gain some more as I have never iterated or remixed a song before.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.13
* TunePad
* TunePad Beat Machine Library
* TunePad Documentation
