# Coding-Convergence

Coding Convergence is a creative coding project that sort to create a trap remix of the indie/pop song 'Eat Your Young' by Hozier. The project consists of an introduction, a first and second verse, a bridge/interlude, two choruses and a short outro of 10 beats.

## General Information

Coding Convergence aims to marry (converge) the coding languages of python and musical notation to create a cohesive piece of music solely through code. The purpose of this project is to recreate muscial complexity and depth through code and to test my own ability as a first-time coder and out-of-practice musician. I undertook this challenge as music is a passion I have negelcted for a number of years and I hoped to rebuild some of the skill I had lost and gain some more as I have never iterated or remixed a song before.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.13
* TunePad
* TunePad Beat Machine Library
* TunePad Documentation

## Features

* Each cell (musical compenent) is interactive and can be viewed to see their construction and place in the remix
* Two 'Code' cells which outline parameters for the entire musical composition
* Various types of instruments and synths for auditory interest

## Setup

To setup 'Coding Convergence' first open the file entitled 'tunepad-project_110924 (3).json' and download the .JSON file. Next sign into TunePad, go to 'My Tunes', select import and import the .JSON file. Now it is ready to be played. 

## Usage

It is recommended you listen with headphones, thought not necessary.
Press the play button in the top right corner to listen to the remix.
Upon hearing the second chorus go to the cell entitled 'Chorus'. Once the second chorus is completed, press the stop button in the top right corner after 10 beats (beat 248) to end the remix.

## Project Status

Project is complete and no longer being worked on as the deadline for this project is 01/11/25. 

## Room for Improvement

* Add more depth and complexity by implementing chords and harmonies throughout the whole song
* Adjust timings
* Possibly find a way to create a uniform end to the musical piece as opposed to relying on the user to manually press the stop button
* Seek to implement more of TunePad's predetermined functions such as high/lowpass and more

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by Hozier's 'Eat Your Young' and TunePad's 'Warm up Activity: Chicago House Beat' from Learn TunePad. 
To create this project a number of tutorials and projects were used. 'Coding Convergence' made use of:
* Learn TunePad Tutorials (Random Trap Beat)
* TunePad Community (Example Project: House Beats)
* TunePad Documentation
* Intoduction to digital music with Python programming: learning music with Code by Horn, West & Roberts (2022)
